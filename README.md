# Console Application for Number-To-Word-in-Java
Following is the implementation. This code supports numbers up-to 6 digits, i.e., numbers from Min Value 00 to Max Value 9,99,999.99. Idea is to create arrays that store individual parts of output strings. One array is used for single digits and  numbers from 10 to 19, one for 20, 30, 40, 50, .. etc.
This code follows recursion.
It is console application where the application runs locally from command prompt.


#Steps to run locally.



#1. Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the java program (MyJavaProgram.java).

#2. Type 'javac -d . MyJavaProgram.java' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line (Assumption: The path variable is set).

#3. Now, type 'java packagename.MyJavaProgram ' to run your program.

#4. You will now be able to see output.
